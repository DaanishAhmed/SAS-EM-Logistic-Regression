Logistic Regression on Cellular Phone Company Churn Data
----------------

This project involves using SAS Enterprise Miner to analyze a dataset containing customer churn information from a cellular phone company.  I will create several distinct logistic regression models to predict whether a given customer will churn.  Each model will use different parameters and variable selection methods.  I will then evaluate the models to find not only the most accurate model, but also the one that can identify the highest number of churners.  My goal is to create a model that can accurately identify likely churners and minimize financial losses for the company.

The full report can be found in the file "Logistic Regression.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, data sampling and partitioning, predictive model development, model results and tuning, model comparison, and proposed solutions.  Tables and visualizations are included in the appendix.

The dataset "Churn at a Cellular Phone Company-mod3.xlsx" was provided by my course instructor at the University of Maryland University College.  I first converted it into a .csv file using Excel.  Next, I converted it to a .sas7bdat file using SAS Enterprise Miner.  Finally, the data source can be imported into your SAS EM project.

The process flow diagram I created for this project (seen in Figure 1 of my report's appendix) is included in the file "logistic regression diagram.xml".  The requirements are described in the file "requirements.txt".  To use this diagram, you need to import the .xml diagram into your SAS EM project.
